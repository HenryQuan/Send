# SendText
Send texts from your phone to your computer in the same network. This is also my first WPF program. 

# Motivation
When I was playing World of Warships and need to send message to my friend in Chinese. It doesn't allow me to do that and I cannot even see all Chinese characters because I set the language to Japanese. Worry no more. I can use send text to my computer and my wpf program will simply copy it to the clipboard. It might also be useful if you want to send a URL to your computer.
