# SendText
Send texts from your Android phone to your Windows computer in the same network.

***Currently, under reconstrcution***

# Ultimate goal
My ultimate goal is to send anything including text, images, files and even shortcuts (keystrokes) on Windows and Mac with iOS and Android apps. 
I might make the UI look like a simple chat just to keep a simple history. 
For the PC side, it will downloads files and images. It also displays text and has the option to copy it. 
The shortcut feature can be really powerful because it could possibly replace a remote express keyboard or even a on-screen hotkey program. 

# Motivation
Sometimes, I need to send messages to my friend in Chinese when I am playing World of Warships. However, the game doesn't allow me to do that and I can't even see all Chinese characters because I set the language to Japanese. Worry no more. I can `SendText` to my computer and my wpf program will simply copy it to the clipboard. It might also be useful if you want to send a URL to your computer. 

# Limitation
1. SendText won't work in certain networks (like university wifi) but home network should be fine (hotspot is ok as well). Maybe it is because of the firewall? but I am not really sure
2. SendText only refreshes every 3 seconds so there might be some delay (but usually it is fine and you won't even notice it at all)
